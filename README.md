# Predicting-Airbnb-prices
Lets go into the business case study observation. We want to overcome to the the problem that the hosts face in determining the optimal night rental price. The price should be nearby to the marketplace for renters. If charge > market place, then renter will go to other alternaitve and if low then we will miss out with the potential revenue
So, the strategy would be:
1) We will find few listings that are similar to our
2) We will average those listings
3) Set this listing price to the calculated average price
